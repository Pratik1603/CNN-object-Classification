# CNN Object Classification using CIFAR-10

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats.

## Overview
This project uses a CNN to extract features from the images and classify them into one of 10 categories. The primary objective is to train a model that can accurately classify unseen images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset
The **CIFAR-10 dataset** includes:
- 60,000 32x32 color images
- 10 classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
  
Each class contains 6,000 images. The dataset is split into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- **Convolutional layers** to extract spatial features from the images (e.g., edges, textures, and shapes).
- **Pooling layers** to down-sample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining key information.
- **Fully connected layers** to map the extracted features to one of the 10 output classes.

The architecture follows this general structure:
1. Convolutional Layer + ReLU Activation
2. Max Pooling Layer
3. Repeat for deeper feature extraction
4. Fully Connected Layer
5. Softmax Activation for final classification

## Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: All images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1 for faster convergence.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and cropping are applied to improve model generalization.

## Training
The model is trained using:
- **Loss function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam or SGD with learning rate scheduling
- **Batch size**: 64 (modifiable based on available resources)
- **Epochs**: Typically 50-100 epochs, depending on training performance.

## Performance
The model is evaluated using the CIFAR-10 test set. Common metrics for evaluating the performance include:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

The training process is monitored via loss and accuracy plots to ensure proper convergence.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework you choose)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting training curves)
- OpenCV or PIL (for image handling)
